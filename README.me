Source code for my B.Sc.'s conclusion project. I was responsible for the Database and Web API developement (identified in the repository by Database and WebApi, respectively).

The Web Api was developed using Spring MVC + Java. The database used was the Microsoft SQL Server; the scripts available were adapted to the particularities of that RDBMS.
